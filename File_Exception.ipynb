    "\n",
    "2. Shared memory and low overhead:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: If the tasks require access to shared data structures, multithreading can be preferable because threads\n",
    " share the same memory space. This makes it easier to pass data between threads without the need for complex inter-\n",
    " process communication mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why multithreading?: Threads can directly access the shared memory, which leads to lower overhead compared to multi-\n",
    "processing, where data must be serialized and transferred between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing, on the other hand, excels when dealing with CPU-bound tasks that require intensive computation, \n",

    "'''A process pool is a collection of pre-allocated worker processes used to execute tasks concurrently. The key \n",

    "es from the pool, avoiding the overhead of continuously creating and destroying processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, instead of spawning a new process each time a task needs to be run (which can be expensive in terms \n",

    "Creating a new process for every task can be expensive, especially in environments with limited resources. A \n",

    "\n",
    "2.Dynamic Task Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you submit a task to the pool, it can be assigned to whichever process is available. This dynamic distribution \n",
